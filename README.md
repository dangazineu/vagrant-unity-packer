#vagrant-trusty64-unity
This project is a build configuration that uses [Packer](https://www.packer.io) to build a Virtualbox image and pack it into a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) box.

At the end of the build, the generated box is published to Atlas so it can be used to create development environments with Vagrant. 

If all you want is a Vagrant box with GUI, you don't need to build a new one, just grab [the box generated by this build](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/danielgazineu/boxes/ubuntu-trusty64-unity).

## Pre-requisites
- Vagrant, Packer and Virtualbox must be installed and available in the path.
- $ATLAS_USERNAME has to be set, so packer can upload the generated box to your account

## Usage

To build and deploy a new box, just run
```
./build.sh
```
